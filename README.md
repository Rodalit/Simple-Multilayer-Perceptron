# Simple multilayer perceptron

SimpleMLP is a basic implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that supports two modes of operation: binary classification and categorical classification. This model is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for learning about neural networks.

To use SimpleMLP, you need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip if you haven't already:

```
pip install numpy
```

The repository has examples of using the model to classify iris and breast cancer.

## Model Parameters

- **i_dim**: Input dimension (default is 1).
- **h_dim**: Hidden layer dimension (default is 16).
- **o_dim**: Output dimension (default is 3).
- **n_iters**: Number of training iterations (default is 500).
- **lr**: Learning rate (default is 2e-4).
- **loss**: Loss function to use, either "binary" or "categorical" (default is "binary").
